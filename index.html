        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>Hi, I'm Farhan Tariq, a passionate Frontend Web Developer with a keen eye for detail and a love for creating intuitive and engaging user experiences. Currently, I am working at Cyber Reconnaissance and Combat Center, where I apply my skills in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to develop efficient and visually appealing web applications.

            My journey in web development began at Bahria University Islamabad Campus, where I pursued a degree in Computer Science. This academic foundation, combined with hands-on experience during my internship at Prodigy InfoTech, has equipped me with a solid understanding of modern web technologies and best practices.
            
            I thrive on the challenge of translating complex requirements into seamless, user-friendly interfaces. My recent projects include developing a weather app and a stopwatch application, showcasing my ability to deliver functional and aesthetically pleasing solutions.
            
            Beyond coding, I am committed to continuous learning and staying updated with the latest trends in web development and cybersecurity. I believe that the blend of creativity and technical expertise is key to building effective digital solutions.
            
            When I'm not coding, you can find me exploring new tech trends, participating in coding challenges, or enjoying a good book.
            
            Let's connect and create something amazing together! </p>
